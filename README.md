# credit-card-fraud
In this kernal I tired to explain the Credit card fraud with help of Anomaly Detection using Gaussian Distribution.



Dataset :https://www.kaggle.com/saiharsha1234/creditcard-fraud-detection . Tools used : Python Libraries used : pandas, numpy, matplot, sklearn, Concepts : PCA,Standardisation,multivariate gaussian,confusion matrix,classification report, Machine Learning Algorithms : Support vector machine .
In confusion matrix True Negative count is 0 on [3,3.5,4] due to 1's lies between -0.5 to 1.35 . So in Normal distributionwe cannot find anomalies.
